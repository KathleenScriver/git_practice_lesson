# Git and Github


## Learning Goals

* Explain the difference between remote and local repositories
* Create a Git repository locally
* Create a repository on GitHub
* Link a local repository to a remote repository
* Use a branching workflow with Git and GitHub









# Warmup

Take a minute and jot down:
  - what you already know about Git/Github.
  - why do we use Git/Github?
    Version Control System
    - distributed
      - creates save points so if we break things we can go back in time to when it wasn't broken
      - collective coding







## Overview

* Git is a version control system that we use in programming.
* GitHub is a website that allows us to share Git repositories.
* In order to keep our code safe we use a branching workflow that allows us to make changes to multiple files before fully commiting to those changes.



## Commits
Unstaged
Staged
Committed




### Important Git Commands
* git init - initialize a local git repository
* git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main (to switch the default of master to main)
* git commit -m "message describing functionality"
